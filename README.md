# **Artificial Image Puzzles**  
This repository explores the creation and manipulation of artificial RGB images using mathematical and logical expressions. It consists of two main projects:

1. **Mathematical RGB Images** – Generating synthetic RGB visuals based on mathematical functions and expressions, illustrating their relationships through plots and meshes.  
2. **Jigsaw RGB Puzzles** – Creating sliding image puzzles by segmenting square images into smaller pieces and randomly shuffling them to generate multiple variations of the challenge.

This project is a fusion of computational creativity and problem-solving, offering unique ways to visualize mathematical concepts and engage with interactive puzzles.
